# Sustainable Beekeeping
MSTU-5003 Final Project
2017 April-May

## Problem Statement
Many novice beekeepers enter beekeeping as a hobby. At its surface, beekeeping is an inviting hobby. People are drawn to beekeeping because it allows people to work with their hands, get outdoors, and produce a delightful product that can be shared with others. There is also plenty of room for experimenting and problem solving to see how to improve the quality or yield of honey.
However, for most beekeepers it is hard to sustain the hobby for more than three years. After this time, bee colonies tend to die off. If the queen bee dies, reproduction comes to an abrupt halt, and the colony collapses. At this point, even the most passionate beekeepers may become frustrated by seeing their colony collapse, and give up their hobby. It can be very hard to find useful information about sustaining bee colonies. Many resources are obscured by scientific jargon or are spread out across different media in an incoherent fashion.

## Purpose
This website is designed to help encourage and support these frustrated beekeepers by offering helpful suggestions and insights that these beekeepers can use to not only keep a bee colony alive, but to even expand it to multiple colonies so they can grow their operations year over year. It will aggregate diverse resources, and sequence the information so different types of learners will be able to easily find information they can use right away.

## Users
#### Profile
Users of this website include beekeepers from all over the world. All age groups are represented. They...
- have at least a beginner's background in beekeeping.
- know the challenges, and have struggled to keep a hive three years.
- are seeing things that aren’t working, but don't know how to find approaches that will work.
- want to invest more time into the process to ensure their hobby will last for a long time.

#### User interaction with site
Users will be directed to the website either through word-of-mouth, or by the recommendation of some other beekeeping resource online. Beekeeper communities tend to be very supportive of one another. There are clubs all over the country and world, and the client is an regular speaker at club meetings (Susquehanna Valley Beekeepers Association) and public outreach events. The client already has a number of popular and highly-recommended resources online (YouTube, articles written on other sites, podcast interviews), and so many will come to the site knowing to expect expert and friendly advice. The client also hopes to capitalize on social media outreach, generating a following on both Twitter and Facebook, in order to direct traffic to his site.

#### User retention
The website should be more than a repository for information. It should also serve as a focal point for engagement among beekeepers. In order to keep users coming back to the site, the client is prepared to provide regular updates to the main blog (maybe semiweekly), and ensure that new content is generated and published to the website often. In the website's future, it may be useful to offer more features for user interaction, such as a public forum where users can share their own insights and experiences about beekeeping with others.

## Content
#### Description of content
Resources that will help intermediate to advanced beekeepers implement sustainable beekeeping practices:
- Make a nucleus colony by working with the natural reproductive tendencies of a beehive
- propogate stock
- expand operations

#### Format of content
- Blog (maybe twice weekly?)
- Embedded YouTube videos
- Articles
- Texts
- Interactive content (initially, a Queen Rearing Calendar)

## Design
#### Client requested design elements
The client did not ask for many specific design features. He only requested that there be honeycomb imagery used throughout and an image of a bee visible at the main page.

#### Tone
The website is intended to be inviting to all beekeepers by reducing formality and adding personalized elements. The client wants to share the narrative of how he got started, and how he persevered, while explaining that his expertise has come as a process of ongoing discovery. He seeks to avoid appearing overly academic, and stresses that much of what he knows comes from his own experiences.

The client has a contagious passion and enthusiasm for beekeeping, and it is important that the website design captures this energy. Copy should be fostering and avoid scientific jargon (but still present basic biology that is essential to successful beekeeping).

#### Quotes
- "I succeeded, you can too!"
- "You can keep five hives, and I can show you how"
- "Try again and again"
- "Go with me and I’ll show you how to do it!"

#### Modes for client-user interaction
The client wants visitors to his website to be able to reach him directly, and he wants to be able to talk back to visitors through a number of channels. To that end, the website should utilize tools that facilitate direct email, sharing of a calendar of events (client talks, meetings, etc.), and blending of social media content (Twitter and Facebook).
