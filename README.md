# Sustainable Beekeeping
MSTU-5003 Final Project
2017 April-May

## Problem Statement
	- Many get into beekeeping as a hobby. They enjoy working outside, producing honey, sharing their product with others, experimenting to see how to increase their yields.
	- By their third year, most new beekeepers have lost a lot of bees. The queen dies, and the colony collapses.
	- At this point, many get frustrated, and most beekeepers don’t last more than three years as a result

## Purpose:
	- This site is designed to help encourage these frustrated beekeepers, to support them by offering helpful suggestions and insights that will help these beekeepers.

## Users
 - Beekeepers from around the world. They...
 		- are intermediate to advanced in beekeeping experience
 		- have been in beekeeping more than 3 years
		- know the challenges, and have struggled to keep a hive three years.
		- are seeing things that aren’t working, but don't know how to find approaches that will work.
		- want to invest more time into the process to ensure their hobby will last for a long time.

- Users will be directed to the site
	- by word of mouth
		- beekeeper community
		- beekeeper clubs (Susquehanna Valley Beekeepers Association)
		- Talks
	- Social media outreach (newly created complementary Twitter and Facebook accounts)

## Content
- Resources that will help intermediate to advanced beekeepers implement sustainable beekeeping practices:
