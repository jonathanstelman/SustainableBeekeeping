# Sustainable Beekeeping
MSTU-5003 Final Project
2017 April-May

## Problem Statement
- Many get into beekeeping as a hobby. They enjoy working outside, producing honey, sharing their product with others, experimenting to see how to increase their yields.
- By their third year, most new beekeepers have lost a lot of bees. The queen dies, and the colony collapses.
- At this point, many get frustrated, and most beekeepers don’t last more than three years as a result

## Purpose
- This site is designed to help encourage these frustrated beekeepers, to support them by offering helpful suggestions and insights that will help these beekeepers.

## Users
 #### Beekeepers from around the world. They...
- are intermediate to advanced in beekeeping experience
- have been in beekeeping more than 3 years
- know the challenges, and have struggled to keep a hive three years.
- are seeing things that aren’t working, but don't know how to find approaches that will work.
- want to invest more time into the process to ensure their hobby will last for a long time.

#### Users will be directed to the site
- by word of mouth
	- beekeeper community
	- beekeeper clubs (Susquehanna Valley Beekeepers Association)
	- Talks
- Social media outreach (newly created complementary Twitter and Facebook accounts)

## Content
#### Description of content
Resources that will help intermediate to advanced beekeepers implement sustainable beekeeping practices:
- Make a nucleus colony using the natural reproductive tendencies of a beehive
- propogate stock
- expand operations
- multiply beehives

#### Format of content
- Blog (maybe twice weekly?)
- Embedded YouTube videos
- Articles

## Style
#### Specifically requested design elements
- Honeycomb
- Picture of a bee

#### Tone
- Informal and personal
- The client wants to share the narrative of how he got started, and how he persevered.
- Explains his discoveries as a process
- Share the client's enthusiasm and energy about beekeeping
- Fostering
- Avoid scientific jargon, but still present basic and essential biology

#### Quotes
- "I succeeded, you can too!"
- "You can keep five hives, and I can show you how"
- "Try again and again"
- "Go with me and I’ll show you how to do it!"

## Other considerations
#### Modes for client-user interaction
- Direct email
- Calendar of events (client talks, meetings, etc.)
- Links to social media sites (Twitter and Facebook)
